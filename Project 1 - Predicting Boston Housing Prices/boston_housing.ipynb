Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "In my opinion an increase both in 'LSTAT' and in 'PTRATIO' leads to a decrease in 'MEDV' because both features indicate a poor neighborhood (lower class people can't afford expensive homes). The 'LSTAT' value shows that directly. The 'PTRATIO' value is also higher in poor neighborhoods because unfortunately it is often the case that in poor neighborhoods the education is not so good because of overfilled classes where the small number of teachers has to cope with many students in class. Finally a poorer neighborhood is an indicator for lower prices for homes."

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

The score of the testing curve is quite unstable and has a high variance. The training curve seems to converge, however the testing curve doesn't seem to converge in the range that is considered. I think more training data would benefit the model so that the model sees enough data to find the patterns that are needed to provide a stable generalization."

You can derive this from the low training and the low generaziation score at this depth. At a maximum depth of 10 the model suffers from a high variance because it has a high training score and a relatively low generalization score. An important cue is also that the difference between the training and generalization score grows monotonically far before the depth of 10."

That reduces the problem that a parameter combination in grid search can lead to a model which is especially bad on a specific split of the data but which is nevertheless overall a good model."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",

However the third value seems too high to me. It's near the maximum (which might be an outlier) and more than 3 standard deviations above the mean. The features of the house are very good, but are they really that good to justify such a high price? I have some doubts about that."

    "**Answer: ** I think the constructed model should not be used in a real-world setting. First the data from 1978 is pretty old. The prices are scaled to account for the inflation, but the situation of living conditions may have changed significantly and so the values of the features may have a different meaning in todays life. Additionally it only considers very few (3) features, so the model is in my opinion too simple for today's life and maybe other features are more relevant today. The robustness of the model is also not good enough. A range in prices of about 70000 is pretty high for a house that is predicted to cost about 400000. Finally I'm quite sure that the data of Boston is not applicable in a rural city and I'm not even sure that the data is applicable in any other city. Boston might be an outlier, so more data from different places are definitely needed for predictions in a real-world setting for today."
