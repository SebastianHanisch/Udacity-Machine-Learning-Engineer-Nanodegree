    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performance would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "1. Gradient Boosted Trees:\n",
    "It is used in the field of machine-learned ranking e.g. to rank web pages (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). It performs well when different types of features (categorial, numerical) are mixed. It also has a high predictive power and is robust to outliers in the output space (I assume when sth. is in an untypical class given its features). It is weak when there is a huge amount of data since it is hard to parallelize due to its serial nature (building trees one after another with different weights after each step, depending on the performance of the previous tree) (source: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting). I think it's a good candidate for the problem because it seems to be an overall good classifier and the data size is moderate and the data consists of heterogeneous features. So it can play out its strenghts and the weakness doesn't matter much.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines:\n",
    "They are used for example for landuse classification (source: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.5721/EuJRS20154823), a special application in image processing. They are effective in high-dimensional spaces (even when the number of features is a bit higher than the number of samples) and memory efficient because of the support vectors. They are also versatile due to the different kernels that are available. A weakness is that they don't provide prediction probabilities directly and can perform poorly if the number of features is much higher than the number of samples (source: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html). They are good candidates because we have 103 features which is in my opinion pretty high and they are versatile. The weaknesses don't matter much regarding our data (number of samples is still far higher than number of features).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Random Forest:\n",
    "This method is for example used for Data Mining and Predictive Analytics (source: https://www.salford-systems.com/). It is one of the most accurate learning algorithms available. It can estimate what features are important for the classification and it can handle many features. A weakness is that Random Forests have been observed to overfit for some datasets with noisy classification tasks (source: http://amateurdatascientist.blogspot.de/2012/01/random-forest-algorithm.html). As an overall good classifier it is a good choice. It can also handle many features and the weakness is probably not important in this case. As Boosted Trees it is based on decision trees which are good at binary features, which we have here due to the one-hot-encoding of the categorial features (source: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-different-classification-algorithms answer of Xavier Amatriain.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all I also chose them, because they seem to be the best general machine learning algorithms apart from neural networks (source: http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/delgado14a/delgado14a.pdf) (and a bit because I find ensemble algorithms fascinating :) ).\n"

    "**Answer: ** The Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) is the best out of the 3 models. The training time is okay, it's not as fast as the RandomForest (RF) but about 10s for training on the whole training set is good and it's much faster than the Support Vector Machine (SVM). A similar observation can be made for the prediction time. It has also only the second best training accuracy and F-score after RF. But it's best when evaluated on the test set, where it has the highest accuracy and the highest F-score regardless of the used training set size which makes it in my opinion the clear winner, because that measures the generalization capabilities which is the most important factor given that the training and prediction times are okay. With an test accuracy above 0.8 and an F_0.5 - score above 0.6 it is suitable for the data because it's clearly better than the naive predictor (and also the inverted naive predictor, predicting always <=50K income). With some optimization I think it will be even better suited for the data. The good performance also comes from the fact that decision tree models are good for categorial variables which form a significant part of the features of the data, so the algorithm fits the charakteristics of the data well."

    "**Answer: ** The Gradient Boosted Tree classifier is a method that averages the results of many simple classifiers in an intelligent way to predict the income. In particular decision trees are used here. These are models that draw few straight lines to separate the data points into two groups. The decision trees are built sequentially and each gets a weighted version of the data where the data points which were often misclassified by the previous trees are more important. That ensures that all data points are classified correctly by many of the simple models. Through the averaging of all models, which can be seen as a kind of vote, most data points are classified correctly by the Gradient Boosted Tree classifier. This is some variant of the \"wisdom of many\" (or \"wisdom of crowds\") applied to the field of machine learning."

My rank 3 choice is occupation because there are significant differences in incomes dependind on what you do. My 4th choice (hours-per-week) is important to rule out persons that only work part-time and therefore are unlikely to get an income >50K but I think those are not many.

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
